#tags, tags are basically substituion strings, a short tag to an arbitrary string
# the following would create a tag "noc" that would map to "-q --no-check-certificate"
# server channel commands that contain <noc> would have that tag replaced with -q --no-check-certificate
# you may specify any number of tags, if you specify multiple tags with same name, only the last one will persist
# in the running enviornment.  tag substitution strings cannot have leading spaces.  Spaces are not trimmed off the end.
#tag noc -q --no-check-certificate
